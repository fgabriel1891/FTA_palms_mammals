# Distinct functional responses of consumers and their producers to climate drive mutualistic network asymmetry


## ABSTRACT

**Aim**: Functional traits are often used to infer the ecological processes that determine the composition of species assemblages. However, most trait-based approaches to infer community assembly processes focus on a single trophic level. Owing to the matching of traits facilitating interactions between resource and consumer assemblages, the functional trait diversity of different trophic levels is expected to covary in space. However, differential response of consumers and producers to environmental gradients can cause a decoupling of functional diversity between trophic levels, which we coin functional trophic asymmetry. Here, we develop a metric to quantify functional trophic asymmetry (FTA)  and use it to infer the processes underpinning multitrophic community assembly, and explore the role of these processes in shaping the topology of ecological networks.
Location: Neotropics.

**Time period**: Present.

Major taxa: Mammalian frugivores and palms.

**Methods**: We use digitally available data on the functional traits, pairwise mutualistic interactions, and geographic distributions of consumers (mammalian frugivores) and their producers (palms) to quantify functional trophic asymmetry for all species occurring in the Neotropics. To cover major data gaps between species-level trait and interaction data, we train machine learning models to generate synthetic network data. on multitrophic traits and probabilistic pairwise interactions. We then use linear regression mixed models to relate functional asymmetry to variation in climate, and to assess the influence of functional asymmetry on network specialization.
Results:  Our approach generated probabilistic networks across 1072 gridcells in the Neotropics, revealing networks with a clearly defined modular structure and substantial differences in their functional richness across trophic levels.  Functional trophic asymmetry increases from warm regions of the Nneotropics with low high precipitation seasonality to cold regions with high low precipitation seasonality. Along this same climatic gradient, network specialization is positively related to the overall strength of FTA across network modules but inversely related to its variability functional trophic asymmetry.

**Main conclusions**:  Our results further suggest that mutualistic interactions between palms and mammals are mediated by matching traits and taxonomic overlap as a key assembly process at the regional scale. We conclude that increased warming and seasonal shifts in precipitation caused by global climate change could disproportionately impact specialist species, while increasing and decreasing functional trophic asymmetry across specific multitrophic species combinations across in network modules of mutualistic networks.
